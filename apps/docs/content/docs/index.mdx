Ritext is a modern WYSIWYG rich text editor for React, built with **Tailwind CSS** and powered by **Tiptap**. It provides a clean composable API that lets you build your own editor UI — toolbars, controls, and layouts — without forcing any specific design on you.

## Key Features

## Architecture

Ritext is split into two layers:

- **Core components** — `Editor`, `Toolbar`, `Content`, and `Renderer` form the shell of your editor.
- **Extensions** — Each formatting feature (bold, italic, heading, image, etc.) is a separate, opt-in extension. You assemble exactly the editor you need.

```tsx
import { Editor, Toolbar, Content } from 'ritext';
import { Bold } from 'ritext/extension/bold';
import { Italic } from 'ritext/extension/italic';
import 'ritext/styles.css';

export default function MyEditor() {
  return (
    <Editor extensions={[Bold, Italic]}>
      <Toolbar />
      <Content />
    </Editor>
  );
}
```

## How It Works

1. You pass an array of **extensions** to the `<Editor>` component.
2. Each extension automatically registers its toolbar button inside `<Toolbar>`.
3. `<Content>` renders the ProseMirror editable area.
4. The order of extensions in your array determines the toolbar button order.
